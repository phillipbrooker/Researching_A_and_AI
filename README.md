# Researching_A_and_AI
This repo contains code files and dataset association with Brooker and Mair (2021) "Researching Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence" (published in The SAGE Handbook of Digital Methods).

The documentation is the actual chapter itself, which gives detail on how to follow and implement these scripts - the only thing not covered, if you wanted to replicate the work done in the chapter, is that the data file needs to be in the same location as the scripts when you run them (there are better ways of handling this if it were an actual deployable system of course, but as the chapter is a tutorial problem, figured it's best to keep it simple).

Thanks!
